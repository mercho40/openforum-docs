psql "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/openforum"

# Update the user's role to admin
UPDATE "user" SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

# Verify the change
SELECT name, email, role FROM "user" WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

# Exit psql
\q
```

**Option B: Using Drizzle Studio**
```bash
# Open Drizzle Studio
pnpm drizzle-kit studio
```

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:4983](http://localhost:4983)
